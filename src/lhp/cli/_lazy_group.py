"""Lazy command loading for the ``lhp`` top-level group.

Importing every command module at startup pulls the whole facade/domain
import graph into ``lhp --version`` and ``lhp --help`` paths, which the
startup refactor (Task U2) eliminates. :class:`LazyGroup` defers each
command's module import until that command is actually resolved, while
keeping rich_click's grouped help panels intact.

Mechanics:

- A ``name -> "module:attr"`` map (``COMMAND_IMPORTS``) replaces the eager
  ``from .commands.X import Y`` block and the matching ``cli.add_command``
  calls in ``cli/main.py``.
- :meth:`LazyGroup.get_command` imports the module on demand, registers the
  resolved command into ``self.commands``, and then delegates to
  ``RichGroup.get_command`` so rich_click's alias mapping still runs.
- :meth:`LazyGroup.list_commands` merges the lazy names with any eagerly
  registered ones, sorted (identical ordering to ``click.Group``).

Panel/help-grouping is preserved because rich_click's help renderer builds
panels from the *resolved* command objects (it calls ``list_commands`` then
``get_command`` for each, reading ``panel``/``hidden`` off the real object).
``lhp --help`` therefore still imports every command module — help legitimately
needs each command's metadata — but ``--version`` and single-command dispatch
no longer pay for commands they never touch.
