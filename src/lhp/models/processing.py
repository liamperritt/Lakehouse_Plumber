    The internal carrier for a single validate finding inside a

    each finding now travels as one of these records, so the
    flowgroup it came from (and the YAML file on disk) is preserved
    all the way to the public :class:`~lhp.api.views.ValidationIssueView`
    instead of being discarded during the per-pipeline fold.

    ``issue`` is the finding itself in one of its two legitimate forms,
    mirroring :class:`FlowgroupOutcome`'s dual-channel error transport:

      - a live :class:`~lhp.errors.LHPError` (structured — ``code`` /
        ``context`` / ``suggestions`` preserved for the rich CLI panel), or
      - a plain ``str`` (the degraded projection — legacy CDC fan-in
        strings, discovery failures, the empty-pipeline message).

    ``flowgroup_name`` is the originating flowgroup, or ``None`` for an
    issue with no single owning flowgroup — a cross-flowgroup fan-in
    finding (:mod:`~lhp.core.coordination._cross_flowgroup_issues`), a
    discovery failure, or the empty-pipeline message.

    ``source_file`` is the flowgroup's source YAML on disk (resolved via
    the ``(pipeline, flowgroup) -> path`` map threaded into
    :func:`~lhp.core.coordination._pool.assemble_validate_outcomes`), or
    ``None`` when there is no owning flowgroup (cross-fg / discovery /
    empty) or no resolvable path.

    ``severity`` is ``"error"`` or ``"warning"`` — matching the public
    :class:`~lhp.api.views.ValidationIssueView` severity literal.

    This is an **internal** transport record, NOT part of the public API
    surface (deliberately absent from ``lhp.api.__all__``). Like its

    Carries the small bit of state the main thread needs after a worker
    finishes a whole pipeline: a success flag, file-count rollups for the
    summary line, the ordered tuple of generated filenames the facade
    surfaces as ``aggregate_generated_filenames``, and — on failure — the
    exception in two forms.

    For :class:`~lhp.errors.LHPError` instances, the live
    exception travels in ``lhp_error`` (pickled via the class's
    :meth:`__reduce__` so subclass identity, ``code``, ``context``,
    ``suggestions`` are preserved verbatim) and the main thread re-raises
    it unchanged. For non-LHP exceptions, only the string projection
    (``error_type`` / ``error_message`` / ``error_traceback``) is
    available across the spawn boundary — tracebacks come through
    pre-formatted via :func:`traceback.format_exception` so the main
    thread can wrap a fresh :class:`LHPError` with the full chained
    context. ``error_message=str(exc)`` is always populated (even when
    ``lhp_error`` is set) so legacy log lines, summary rows, and tests
    that read it keep working.

    Only filenames travel back (no file *contents*) — on the performance
    project this keeps the worker→main pickle to ~50 KB. Consumers that
    need the formatted code (none currently do) must read it from disk.

    ``wheel_filename`` is INTERNAL telemetry: the packaged ``.whl`` filename

      - Immutability across the spawn boundary: workers can't accidentally
        mutate a delta after it's been queued for the main thread.
