"""LHP public API surface.

CLI and external consumers MUST import from this package only. Internal
domain modules (``lhp.core``, ``lhp.bundle``, ``lhp.parsers``,
``lhp.models``, ``lhp.generators``) are not part of the public contract
and may change without notice.

The canonical entry points are:

- :class:`LakehousePlumberApplicationFacade` for runtime operations.
- :class:`LakehousePlumberBootstrap` for new-project scaffolding.

Long-running operations (``generate_pipelines``, ``validate_pipelines``,
``BundleFacade.sync_resources``) return an ``Iterator[LHPEvent]`` per
constitution §1.2 / §5.7. Callers that don't need event-level
visibility use :func:`collect_response` to walk the stream and return
the terminal response DTO.

    """Walk an LHPEvent stream and return the terminal ``response``.

    Callers who don't need event-level visibility use this helper::

        response = collect_response(facade.generate_pipelines(...))

    The iterator is exhausted. If the stream emits :class:`ErrorEmitted`
    and the underlying generator raises, the raise propagates from this
    function — callers handle the raise.

    The return type is ``object`` here for typing-flexibility; the
    actual returned value is the response DTO of whichever stream was
    consumed (:class:`BatchGenerationResponse` /
    :class:`BatchValidationResponse` / :class:`BundleSyncResult` /
    :class:`GenerationPlan`). Annotate at the call site if you need a
    precise type.

    Terminal events are discovered via the :class:`OperationCompleted`
    base, so this helper does not need to enumerate concrete subclasses.

    :param warnings_sink: Optional mutable sequence. When supplied, every
        :class:`WarningEmitted` seen while draining the stream is appended
        to it in arrival order, so non-stream callers can recover the
        warnings the stream surfaced without iterating it themselves.
        Defaults to ``None`` (warnings are drained and discarded, exactly
        as before — the return value is unchanged either way). This
        parameter and the :class:`WarningEmitted` type it collects are
        ``:stability: provisional``; the ``:stability: stable`` guarantee
        below covers the return contract only.
