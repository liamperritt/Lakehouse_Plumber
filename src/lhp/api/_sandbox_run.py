"""Sandbox preflight resolution shared by the generate and validate streams.

Underscore-prefixed module: not part of :mod:`lhp.api`'s public surface.
External callers MUST NOT import from here.

Holds the single seam that turns a ``sandbox=True`` run's inputs into the
frozen :class:`~lhp.models.processing.SandboxRunConfig` the workers consume:
load the personal profile (``.lhp/profile.yaml``), read the team policy
(``lhp.yaml`` ``sandbox:`` block off the orchestrator's project config), and
delegate the merge + scope resolution to
:func:`lhp.core.sandbox.resolve_sandbox_run`.

Consumed by the generate stream (:mod:`lhp.api._generate_stream`) and the
validate stream (:mod:`lhp.api._validation_facade`) inside their ``sandbox``
branches. NO event emission happens here — the STREAMS own the §1.4
``ErrorEmitted`` + raise rendezvous for the :class:`~lhp.errors.LHPError`
failures this helper propagates.

Import discipline: this module imports ``lhp.core`` at module level, so it
must only be imported LAZILY at call time (the way the generation facade
defer-imports :mod:`lhp.api._generate_stream`) — an eager import from a
module loaded by ``import lhp.api`` would drag the core stack into API
import time.
