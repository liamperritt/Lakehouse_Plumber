"""Process-pool executor service for cross-pipeline parallel execution.

This module holds :class:`PipelineExecutionService`, the orchestrator-facing
facade that implements :class:`BasePipelineExecutionService`. It drives the
consolidated flat per-flowgroup engine
(:func:`._pool._run_flowgroup_pool_core`, ``mode`` the only fork) for both
validate and generate; the single-flowgroup worker entry, its captured
:class:`_FlowgroupWorkerState`, and the worker initializer live on the
worker seam :mod:`lhp.core.coordination._flowgroup_pool`. Those seam symbols
are re-exported below to preserve their import path (``from .executor import
_FlowgroupWorkerState, ...``) for tests and the pickle-by-name contract.

:class:`PipelineExecutionService` carries per-batch reconfiguration and the
two ABC-typed methods :meth:`run_generate` / :meth:`run_validate` — both
generators that ``yield from`` their engine source of truth
(:meth:`_iter_generate_deltas` / :meth:`_iter_validate_outcomes`) and RETURN
the batch's merged worker deprecation warnings via ``StopIteration.value`` for
the facade to re-emit. :class:`PipelineValidationOutcome` (the validate outcome
DTO) lives in the leaf module :mod:`._validation_outcome` and is re-exported
here, so both this module and the engine import it without an
``executor`` ↔ ``_pool`` cycle. Engine / worker invariants (picklable-only
collaborators, never-raise workers) are documented in :mod:`._pool` /
:mod:`._flowgroup_pool`.
