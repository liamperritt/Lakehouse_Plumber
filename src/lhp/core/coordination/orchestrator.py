"""Main orchestration for LakehousePlumber pipeline generation.

:class:`ActionOrchestrator` is the composition root wiring eight
ABC-typed collaborator services (discovery, flowgroup resolution,
validation, code generation, dependency analysis, monitoring,
execution, bootstrap) and exposing seven public methods to callers
(CLI commands and :class:`LakehousePlumberApplicationFacade`).

Per Target Architecture §4 (thin coordination layer), callers use the
public services directly (``.bootstrap``, ``.discovery``,
``.processing``, ``.codegen``); the orchestrator exposes only these seven
methods, each the narrowest surface for its responsibility:
``discover_flowgroups`` (single-pipeline directory read);
``finalize_monitoring_artifacts`` (end-of-run notebook/job write);
``generate_pipelines`` (pure delta-generator — builds the batch worklist,
hands to :class:`PipelineExecutionService`, does NOT format);
``resolve_apply_formatting`` (single seam resolving the
``apply_formatting`` tri-state to a bool);
``format_output_tree`` (single terminal ``ruff format`` pass over the
output tree — perf-wrapped delegate to ``codegen.formatter``);
``validate_pipelines`` (batch validate; hands to
:class:`PipelineExecutionService`);
``build_sandbox_rewrite_plan`` (``--sandbox`` pre-pass — thin
delegate to ``coordination.sandbox_prepass``). The format primitive
(``resolve_apply_formatting`` + ``format_output_tree``) lives here but is
INVOKED by each caller AFTER it drains ``generate_pipelines``.

        both are ``None`` no pipelines are generated and the stream is
        empty (the caller is expected to discover the pipeline list first;
        see :class:`GenerationFacade`).

        This is a PURE delta-generator: it does NOT format. There is no
        ``apply_formatting`` parameter — formatting is the caller's
        responsibility AFTER draining this generator. The two callers (the
        generate event stream and the read-only plan path) each resolve the
        ``apply_formatting`` tri-state via :meth:`resolve_apply_formatting` and
        run the single terminal ruff pass themselves (:meth:`format_output_tree`);
        the execution service never formats either.

        Routes through the consolidated flat per-flowgroup engine,
        mirroring :meth:`validate_pipelines`:
        :func:`flowgroup_worklist_builder.build_flowgroup_worklist` produces the
        flat four-map shape — here with a REAL ``output_dir`` (generate writes;
        validate passes ``None``), so each pipeline's ``output_dirs`` entry is
        ``output_dir / <pipeline>`` (and is created on disk by the builder). The
        per-pipeline cross-flowgroup validation now runs on the RESOLVED
        flowgroups INSIDE the engine (§9.24).

        :meth:`PipelineExecutionService.run_generate` drives the engine in
        ``mode="generate"``, applies the all-or-nothing GATE (RAISES on any
        failure, before any write — so this method no longer wraps the call in
        an aggregate-and-raise step), then commits each clean pipeline (writing
        UNFORMATTED source). This is a GENERATOR: it ``yield from``
        ``run_generate``, surfacing the per-pipeline :class:`PipelineDelta`s in
        input order (every failure delta first, then the gate raise per §1.4,
        then a success delta per committed pipeline); once that stream drains
        cleanly it runs the terminal format here. It RETURNS (via
        ``StopIteration.value``, captured by the facade's ``yield from``) the
        batch's merged + deduped worker deprecation warnings for the facade to
        re-emit as :class:`~lhp.api.WarningEmitted` events.
        A per-pipeline discovery failure (carried in the worklist's
        ``discovery_errors`` map) aborts the whole batch inside ``run_generate``
        — generate is all-or-nothing.

        ``sandbox_plan`` is the ``--sandbox`` rewrite plan from
        :meth:`build_sandbox_rewrite_plan`; its ``renames`` ride the worker
        state across the spawn boundary so every worker applies the
        table-rename hooks (structured pass on the resolved flowgroup +
        text pass over the generated Python). ``None`` (the default) is the
        legacy no-rewrite path, byte-identical to a run without the kwarg.
