"""Service ABCs for the LHP coordination layer.

Each ABC is the load-bearing seam between the orchestrator and one
concrete implementation; the orchestrator type-hints these ABCs so future
re-wires (test doubles, alternate transports, future plugin surfaces) only
have to satisfy the contract rather than mimic a concrete class shape.

**Why `abc.ABC` and not `typing.Protocol`.** Per constitution §4.12, internal
contracts with one or more implementations are defined as
:class:`abc.ABC` subclasses with :func:`abc.abstractmethod`. ABC fails fast at
construction when a method is missing (services are wired at orchestrator
init time, so a TypeError there is operationally superior to an AttributeError
on first call). ABC also gives IDE "show subclasses" support immediately,
covers the ``mypy --strict`` gap outside ``lhp/api/`` (§4.3), and leaves room
to add shared entry/exit telemetry in one place.

**§5.5 reminder.** No ABC in this file type-hints another ABC's class.
Services do not call each other — composition is the orchestrator's job.
