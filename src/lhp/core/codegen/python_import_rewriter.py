"""Prefix-rewrite a copied user module's absolute-local imports.

A user entry/helper module copied under ``custom_python_functions/`` keeps
its original ``from helpers.foo import bar`` text, which resolved top-level
before the move but no longer does once the file lives inside the package.
:func:`rewrite_local_imports` re-points every *absolute-local* import under
the ``custom_python_functions`` prefix so it resolves post-relocation, while
leaving relative and external imports untouched.

The locality decision is delegated to
:func:`lhp.core.codegen.python_dependency_resolver.resolve_module_on_disk` —
the same on-disk predicate the closure uses — so the set of imports this
rewriter prefixes is exactly the set the closure copies (PEP 420
namespace-package members included). Rewriting is byte-precise string surgery
on the import statement spans, never an ``ast.unparse`` of the whole module:
comments, blank lines, and code outside the rewritten imports are preserved
verbatim.

    Returns ``source`` with every absolute-local ``from`` import re-pointed
    under ``custom_python_functions`` so it still resolves once the file is
    copied beneath that package. The locality decision reuses
    :func:`resolve_module_on_disk` — the exact predicate
    :func:`resolve_local_closure` uses — so closure and rewrite agree on what
    is local (including PEP 420 namespace-package members, which the substrate
    reports ``is_local=False`` yet both functions still treat as local because
    they re-resolve on disk under ``root``).

    Rewrite/preserve/error rules (applied uniformly to the entry and every
    helper, post-substitution):

    - ``from pkg.mod import x`` (resolves under ``root``) →
      ``from custom_python_functions.pkg.mod import x``; ``from pkg import x``
      → ``from custom_python_functions.pkg import x``. Aliases are preserved.
    - ``from .sibling import x`` (relative, ``level > 0``) → unchanged.
    - ``import os`` / ``from pyspark.sql import functions`` (not under
      ``root``) → unchanged.
    - ``import pkg.mod`` / ``import pkg.mod as c`` of a *local* module →
      ``LHP-VAL-024`` (the bound dotted name cannot be relocated without
      rebinding call sites; the user is directed to a ``from`` form).

    Only the exact source span of each rewritten statement is replaced (via
    the node's ``lineno`` / ``col_offset`` / ``end_lineno`` /
    ``end_col_offset``); all other bytes — comments, blank lines, code — are
    preserved verbatim. Multi-line / parenthesized imports are handled through
    the node's end position. The whole tree is walked (``ast.walk``) so lazy /
    function-body imports are rewritten too, matching closure discovery.

    Args:
        source: The module's full source text (already token-substituted).
        tree: The parsed ``ast.Module`` for ``source``.
        root: The closure root ``R`` (the entry file's own directory).

    Returns:
        The source with absolute-local imports prefixed.
