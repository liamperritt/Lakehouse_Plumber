"""Build an in-memory generation plan that is byte-for-byte a real generate.

Single responsibility: **produce the exact file tree a real ``generate`` would
write to ``generated/<env>``, without touching the real output directory.**

The parity-guaranteed primitive behind the public generation *plan* surface
(``lhp.api.GenerationPlan`` — assembled by the API layer from the core
structure this module returns; ``core`` must not import ``lhp.api``, §5.x
layering). It works by driving the *real* generate flow against a throwaway
:class:`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` instead of ``generated/<env>``:

    drive ``ActionOrchestrator.generate_pipelines(output_dir=<temp>, ...)``
      → the engine pool codegens every flowgroup (mode=``generate``)
      → the all-or-nothing gate raises on any failure (no writes)
      → :func:`~lhp.core.coordination._commit.commit_generate_results` writes
        every committed pipeline's files into ``<temp>/<pipeline>/``
    then, after the generator is fully drained, run the single terminal
    :meth:`~lhp.core.coordination.orchestrator.ActionOrchestrator.format_output_tree`
    pass over ``<temp>`` — the SAME primitive the generate event stream drives
    after consuming the same generator (``generate_pipelines`` is a pure
    delta-generator and no longer formats at its tail).

then READ the formatted ``<temp>`` tree back into an ordered collection of
:class:`PlannedArtifact`\\ s (path *relative to the temp root*, so it matches
the real ``generated/<env>`` layout) and DISCARD the temp dir.

Why drive the real orchestrator rather than re-run the pool here: reusing the
unmodified generate driver — same pool, same gate, same
``commit_generate_results`` writer, and the same terminal
``format_output_tree`` pass run identically by the real generate's event stream
— is exactly what guarantees the plan is byte-for-byte identical to a real
generate. Re-implementing the commit/gate/pool drive in this module would both
duplicate the coordination logic and reach the engine internals
(``_run_flowgroup_pool_core`` / ``gate_or_raise``) the coordination package
keeps private (§4.6). The only difference between a plan and a real generate is
the ``output_dir`` (a temp dir) and that monitoring *finalization* (notebook +
job-resource writes, which land in the project root, NOT under
``generated/<env>``) is deliberately NOT run — a plan must not mutate the real
project tree. The synthetic monitoring *pipeline* file
(``<monitoring_pipeline>/monitoring.py``) IS produced, because it is a normal
flowgroup discovered by ``discover_all_flowgroups`` and committed under
``output_dir`` like any other flowgroup.

Artifact-kind classification (``PlannedArtifact.kind``) is derived from where
each file lands in the per-pipeline output tree — the deterministic landing
scheme of the commit step — plus the per-pipeline flowgroup filename set the
drive reports through its ``PipelineDelta`` stream. See
:func:`_classify_artifact`.

        orchestrator: The constructed orchestrator for the project. Its
            ``generate_pipelines`` is driven with a temp ``output_dir``.

        pipeline_filter: Single pipeline field to plan, OR
        pipeline_fields: Batch of pipeline fields to plan (mutually exclusive
            with ``pipeline_filter``; passing neither plans nothing).
        specific_flowgroups: Forwarded for signature parity with the real
            generate (the orchestrator does not narrow by it at this layer).
        include_tests: Emit test actions + the per-pipeline test-reporting hook.
        apply_formatting: Tri-state terminal-format override forwarded verbatim
            (``None`` → use the project's ``lhp.yaml`` ``apply_formatting``;
            ``True`` / ``False`` override it) — the plan formats exactly as the
            equivalent real generate would.
        pre_discovered_all_flowgroups: Optional pre-discovered flowgroup list
            (single-parse reuse), forwarded so the plan's discovery — including
            the synthetic monitoring flowgroup — matches the real generate's.
        max_workers: Pool fan-out override.
        on_pipeline_complete: Optional per-pipeline ``PipelineDelta`` sink, fired
            in commit order during the drive.
        on_total: Optional per-FLOWGROUP total hook, called once with the flat
            worklist length before the pool runs. Forwarded verbatim to
            ``generate_pipelines`` (plain ``Callable``; ``core`` owns no
            ``lhp.api`` dependency) so a plan drives the same flowgroup-grained
            progress the real generate does.
        on_flowgroup_done: Optional per-FLOWGROUP completion hook, called once
            per finished flowgroup with the completed flowgroup's PIPELINE name
            (a plain ``str``). Forwarded verbatim to ``generate_pipelines``.
