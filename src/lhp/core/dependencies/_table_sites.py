"""Value objects describing recognized table-consuming call sites.

Produced by the extraction visitor
(:mod:`lhp.core.dependencies._extraction_visitor`) and surfaced through
:func:`lhp.core.dependencies.python_parser.collect_python_table_sites`. The
records carry exactly what a source rewriter needs: where a table-name (or
inline-SQL) string literal lives in the source bytes, or — when the argument
is statically resolvable but not a plain literal — which table names it can
take, so the caller can warn about in-scope reads it cannot rewrite.

These types live in their own module (not ``python_parser``) because both the
visitor and the parser construct/return them; placing them on the parser
would force a runtime import cycle (the parser already imports the visitor).

class PythonTableSite:
    """One recognized table-consuming call site.

    ``kind`` discriminates the call shape:

    - ``"table_read"`` — the argument IS a table name: ``spark.table``,
      ``spark.read/readStream.table``, allowlisted
      ``spark.read/readStream.format(fmt).table/load`` chains, and
      ``spark.catalog.tableExists`` / ``spark.catalog.dropTempView``.
    - ``"spark_sql"`` — ``spark.sql(...)``: the argument is SQL text that
      may reference tables.

    Classification (mutually exclusive):

    - ``rewritable=True`` — the argument is a direct ``ast.Constant`` string
      literal. ``span`` locates the literal in the source as parsed;
      ``value`` is the literal's value (the table name for ``table_read``,
      the SQL text for ``spark_sql``); ``resolved_values`` is empty.
    - ``rewritable=False`` — the argument is not a plain constant but
      resolved statically (variable, YAML parameter binding, f-string,
      concatenation, conditional union). ``span`` / ``value`` are ``None``;
      ``resolved_values`` carries the candidate TABLE NAMES — for
      ``spark_sql`` sites these are the tables extracted from each resolved
      SQL text, so matching semantics are uniform across kinds.

    Opaque arguments (static resolution returned nothing) are never recorded
    — those are LHP-DEP-002 advisory territory, not rewrite candidates.

    ``lineno`` is the 1-based line of the call expression itself and is
    present for both classifications.
