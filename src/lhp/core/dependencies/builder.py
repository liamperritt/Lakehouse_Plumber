"""Dependency graph builder: graph construction from a given flowgroup set.

Owns the construction pipeline that turns a *given* flowgroup set (plus the
file-path index that maps each flowgroup to its source YAML) into a
``DependencyGraphs`` triple (action / flowgroup / pipeline). Discovery,
processing, and blueprint view-mode live on the
:class:`DependencyAnalysisService` composition root; the builder is handed
``(flowgroups, file_paths)`` and never touches the filesystem to discover them.

Per-action source extraction (parsing SQL/Python bodies into upstream table
references) lives in :mod:`.source_parsing`; ``_build_action_graph``
constructs a :class:`SourceParser` over the *passed-in* file-path index and
delegates to it.
