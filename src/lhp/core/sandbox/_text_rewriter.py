"""Guarded text-level table-reference rewriting for sandbox mode.

The structured rewrite pass owns YAML-field writes; THIS module is the text
primitive for opaque payloads (SQL files/strings, ``spark.sql`` literals in
Python sources): given the sandbox rename set, it swaps the table-LEAF
segment of every textual occurrence of a rename-set table and leaves every
other byte of the text untouched.

This module never decides membership or applies the rename pattern itself:

- candidate spans proposed by a guarded regex are CONFIRMED through
  :func:`._renames.match_renamed_table` (the canonical 2-part<->3-part rule
  keeps its single implementation), and
- the replacement leaf comes from :func:`._renames.rename_parts` (the
  pattern-application choke point).

Idempotency falls out of the guards: a renamed leaf (``alice_tbl`` /
``tbl_alice``) never equals a rename-key leaf, the word-char lookarounds stop
re-matches that would start or end inside one, and the canonical re-check
rejects any residual candidate that no longer resolves to its own key.

# or `${catalog}.sch.tbl`), after `$` (an unresolved substitution-token
# remnant), or after a backtick (inside a quoted part). It must not be
# FOLLOWED by a word char / `$` / backtick (it would be a strict prefix of a
