"""Public surface of the developer-sandbox rewrite sub-package.

Implements the ``--sandbox`` rewrite engine (TARGET_ARCHITECTURE §5ter):
renaming tables produced by in-scope pipelines to per-developer names.
Layering: this sub-package imports DOWNWARD only (``core/dependencies`` via
its package ``__init__``, ``models``, ``errors``, ``utils``, stdlib) — never
from ``core/coordination``, ``api``, ``cli``, ``generators``, or ``bundle``.
