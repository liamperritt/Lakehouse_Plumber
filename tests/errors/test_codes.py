"""Registry-completeness / drift guard for ``lhp.errors.codes``.

This is the safety net that makes ``ALL_CODES`` a *verified mirror* of the
raise sites rather than a parallel list that silently drifts. Two guarantees:

1. Per-constant code synthesis (``test_per_constant_code_synthesis``) — every
   :class:`ErrorCode` reproduces the exact ``LHP-<CAT>-<NNN>`` string that
   ``LHPError.__init__`` synthesizes (``errors/types.py``), and no two records
   collapse to the same rendered ``.code``.

2. SSOT subset guarantee (``test_registry_is_superset_of_literal_raise_sites``)
   — every *literal* error-code construction found by statically scanning
   ``src/lhp/`` is present in the registry. The direction is deliberately
   **subset** (raise-sites ⊆ registry), NOT equality, so it stays green as
   raise sites migrate to the factory: fewer literals exist, but the remaining
   ones are still a subset. The exact-match end-state (registry ==
   raise-sites) is enforced by ``test_no_stray_literal_codes_end_state``.

Scan technique — **regex / line-based text reading, never AST**. This is
intentional: the scan must be robust to a source file being mid-edit by a
concurrent process (a half-written file must not crash collection).

What the scan matches
---------------------
The real unit of error identity is the ``(ErrorCategory, code_number)`` pair
(the same ``code_number`` recurs across categories). A code is synthesized,
never stored, so we capture the two halves of each construction:

  * a *literal* keyword argument ``code_number="NNN"`` (or single-quoted),
    written with **no space** around ``=`` (the keyword-argument convention
    that ruff/black enforce). Requiring no space deliberately excludes plain
    *assignments* like ``code_number = "000"`` (a local default) and class
    attributes like ``_code_number = "020"`` — those are not construction
    call-sites.
  * the ``ErrorCategory.<MEMBER>`` it is paired with. In every literal raise
    site today the ``category=`` (or ``_category =``) precedes ``code_number=``
    within the same construction, so the category is resolved as the *nearest
    preceding* ``ErrorCategory.<MEMBER>`` in the file text. (Verified: 0
    unpaired literal sites across ``src/lhp/``.)

Excluded from the scan
-----------------------
  * ``src/lhp/errors/codes.py`` — the registry itself (would be circular).
  * ``src/lhp/errors/factory.py`` — the factory; it sources pairs *from*
    ``codes.py``, so scanning it would be circular too. (Guarded for absence:
    a non-existent path simply never appears in the walk.)

End-state allowlist — see ``_LITERAL_CODE_NUMBER_ALLOWLIST``
-----------------------------------------------------------
After the ErrorFactory migration the ONLY legitimate literal
``code_number="NNN"`` occurrences are:

  (a) the registry (``errors/codes.py``) and the factory
      (``errors/factory.py``) — EXCLUDED from the scan; the registry uses
      positional ``ErrorCode(ErrorCategory.X, "NNN")`` and the factory stamps
      ``code_number=code.number`` (a variable), so neither produces a literal
      ``code_number="…"`` match anyway;
  (b) helper call-args — a literal forwarded into a helper whose construction
      uses ``code_number=<that variable>`` (``_build_family_error`` in
      ``core/coordination/_cross_flowgroup_issues.py`` and
      ``_resolve_and_parse_file`` in ``core/dependencies/source_parsing.py``); and
  (c) custom-subclass / type-definition constructions in ``errors/types.py``
      whose bespoke ``__init__``/dispatch call
      ``super().__init__(..., code_number="NNN", ...)`` directly.

(b) and (c) are enumerated exhaustively in the module-level
``_LITERAL_CODE_NUMBER_ALLOWLIST`` and enforced by
``test_no_stray_literal_codes_end_state``. Anything else is a raise site that
bypassed the factory.

Two related forms are intentionally NOT in the allowlist because the strict
no-space ``_CODE_NUMBER_RE`` does not match them: spaced *assignments* like the
``code_number = "000"`` default in ``cli/commands/init_command.py`` and the
``_code_number = "020"`` class attrs on the bundle subclasses in
``errors/types.py``. The empty round-trip note ``code_number=""`` in
``api/_converters_common.py`` is likewise excluded (the regex requires ≥1 char).

This file lives in ``tests/errors/`` with **no** ``__init__.py`` (collection is
``testpaths``-based; sibling test dirs like ``tests/api/`` carry none — adding
one here causes import-mode surprises).

#
#   (b) HELPER CALL-ARGS — a literal forwarded into a helper whose own

#       hosts the closed set of LHP exception classes. A handful of them have
#       bespoke ``__init__`` signatures (or a worker-reconstruction dispatcher)
#       that call ``super().__init__(..., code_number="NNN", ...)`` directly.
#       These ARE the type definitions; the factory sources its codes *from*
#       the registry but does not own these custom constructors. ``types.py``
#       is deliberately NOT excluded from the scan, so they are enumerated here.
#       (The four bundle subclasses also declare ``_code_number = "020"`` style
#       class attrs, but those are spaced *assignments* that the no-space
#       ``_CODE_NUMBER_RE`` does not match — they need no allowlist entry.)
#
# The scan uses the same strict no-space ``_CODE_NUMBER_RE`` as the subset test,
# so this allowlist is keyed by the literal form that regex actually matches.
# Entries are keyed on ``(relative_posix_path, code_number)`` — robust to line
# drift but precise to the exact file and code. Any literal ``code_number="…"``
